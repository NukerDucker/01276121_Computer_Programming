## Chapter : 8 - item : 5 - 24s1 Center-starting Spiral Rectangle XXX

Complete the **generate_spiral** function and **print_spiral** function.

```generate_spiral``` function:
This function can accept between one and three parameters: ```h```, ```direction```, and ```word```.

```h```: Defines the size of the returned 2-dimensional square matrix.
```direction``` (optional): Specifies the initial direction of the spiral fill within the matrix. Valid options are 'left', 'right', 'up', or 'down'. If not provided, the default direction is 'right'.
```word``` (optional): When this parameter is provided, the matrix is filled using the characters of the word. Characters are used to fill the matrix sequentially, repeating in a pattern that increases incrementally. For example, if the word is 'abcde', the matrix will be filled with 'abcde', then 'bcdef' twice, then 'cdefg' three times, and so on.
If only the ```h``` parameter is provided, the function fills the matrix with numbers starting from 1 in a clockwise spiral manner from the center.

```print_spiral``` function:
- This function requires one parameter: a 2-dimensional list (matrix).
- It prints the matrix with proper alignment, ensuring each element is displayed in a manner that maintains the structure and readability of the spiral pattern.
```Python
# Do NOT Modify the following code
print(" *** Center-starting Spiral Rectangle XXX ***")
inp = input("Enter side [direction] [word] : ")

args = inp.split()

# Generate and print the spiral
spiral_rectangle = generate_spiral( *args)

print_spiral(spiral_rectangle)

print("===== End of program ======")
```

### This is my approach
```Python
def generate_spiral(*args):
    h = int(args[0])
    matrix = [[''] * h for _ in range(h)]
    direction = args[1] if len(args) > 1 else 'right'  
    word = args[2] if len(args) > 2 else None 
    
    if h % 2 != 0:
        row, col = h // 2, h // 2
    else:
        if direction == 'right':
            row, col = h // 2 - 1, h // 2 - 1 
        elif direction == 'left':
            row, col = h // 2, h // 2 
        elif direction == 'up':
            row, col = h // 2, h // 2 - 1
        elif direction == 'down':
            row, col = h // 2 - 1, h // 2

    if direction == 'up':
        directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]  # up -> right -> down -> left
    elif direction == 'down':
        directions = [(1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1)]  # down -> left -> up -> right
    elif direction == 'left':
        directions = [(0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]  # left -> up -> right -> down
    elif direction == 'right':
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right -> down -> left -> up

    current_direction = 0
    step_size = 1
    total_steps = 0
    steps_in_current_direction = 0
    count = 0
    
    if word:
        word = list(word)
        word_list_iter = []
        current_loop_time = 1
        loop_iter = 0
        for _ in range(h):
            word_list_iter.extend(word)
            loop_iter += 1
            if current_loop_time == loop_iter:
                word = [chr(ord(char) + 1) for char in word]
                current_loop_time += 1
                loop_iter = 0
        iter_count = 0
    else:
        num = 1

    while count < h * h:
        if word:
            matrix[row][col] = word_list_iter[iter_count]
            iter_count += 1
        else:
            matrix[row][col] = str(num)
            num += 1
            
        count += 1
        steps_in_current_direction += 1

        row += directions[current_direction][0]
        col += directions[current_direction][1]

        if steps_in_current_direction == step_size:
            current_direction = (current_direction + 1) % 4
            steps_in_current_direction = 0
            total_steps += 1
            if total_steps % 2 == 0:
                step_size += 1

    return matrix

def print_spiral(matrix):
    max_width = max(len(str(element)) for row in matrix for element in row)
    for row in matrix:
        col_index = 0 
        for element in row:
            if col_index == 0:
                print(f"{element:>{max_width}}", end=" ")
            else: 
                print(f"{element:>{max_width + 1}}", end=" ")
            col_index += 1
        print()

print(" *** Center-starting Spiral Rectangle XXX ***")
inp = input("Enter side [direction] [word] : ")

args = inp.split()

spiral_rectangle = generate_spiral( *args)

print_spiral(spiral_rectangle)

print('===== End of program ======')
```
#### Why I chose this approach.
I based this code from the previous spiral retangle chapter 6 and 7 which helps me dont need to rewrite the entire things. and also this is what I could draw a picture of how its work in my head. the code is also structured to be flexible, allowing both numerical and character-based filling, and it adjusts the starting position based on the matrix size and direction.

#### Let's dissect this.
Start with ```generate_spiral()```.
```Python
def generate_spiral(*args):
    h = int(args[0])
    matrix = [[''] * h for _ in range(h)]
    direction = args[1] if len(args) > 1 else 'right'  
    word = args[2] if len(args) > 2 else None 
    
    if h % 2 != 0:
        row, col = h // 2, h // 2
    else:
        if direction == 'right':
            row, col = h // 2 - 1, h // 2 - 1 
        elif direction == 'left':
            row, col = h // 2, h // 2 
        elif direction == 'up':
            row, col = h // 2, h // 2 - 1
        elif direction == 'down':
            row, col = h // 2 - 1, h // 2

    if direction == 'up':
        directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]  # up -> right -> down -> left
    elif direction == 'down':
        directions = [(1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1)]  # down -> left -> up -> right
    elif direction == 'left':
        directions = [(0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]  # left -> up -> right -> down
    elif direction == 'right':
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right -> down -> left -> up

    current_direction = 0
    step_size = 1
    total_steps = 0
    steps_in_current_direction = 0
    count = 0
    
    if word:
        word = list(word)
        word_list_iter = []
        current_loop_time = 1
        loop_iter = 0
        for _ in range(h):
            word_list_iter.extend(word)
            loop_iter += 1
            if current_loop_time == loop_iter:
                word = [chr(ord(char) + 1) for char in word]
                current_loop_time += 1
                loop_iter = 0
        iter_count = 0
    else:
        num = 1

    while count < h * h:
        if word:
            matrix[row][col] = word_list_iter[iter_count]
            iter_count += 1
        else:
            matrix[row][col] = str(num)
            num += 1
            
        count += 1
        steps_in_current_direction += 1

        row += directions[current_direction][0]
        col += directions[current_direction][1]

        if steps_in_current_direction == step_size:
            current_direction = (current_direction + 1) % 4
            steps_in_current_direction = 0
            total_steps += 1
            if total_steps % 2 == 0:
                step_size += 1

    return matrix
```

## ```generate_spiral()```
#### Input and Setup
```Python
def generate_spiral(*args):
    h = int(args[0])
    matrix = [[''] * h for _ in range(h)]
    direction = args[1] if len(args) > 1 else 'right'  
    word = args[2] if len(args) > 2 else None 
```
The function takes in a variable number of arguments ```(*args)```, where:
- ```args[0]```: The size of the matrix, h. It is converted to an integer.
- ```args[1]```: The direction of the spiral, defaulting to 'right' if not provided.
- ```args[2]```: An optional word that will be used to fill the matrix, defaulting to None if not provided.
  
The matrix is initialized as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row. Initially, all elements are empty lists ```['']```.

---
#### Starting Position
```Python
 if h % 2 != 0:
        row, col = h // 2, h // 2
    else:
        if direction == 'right':
            row, col = h // 2 - 1, h // 2 - 1 
        elif direction == 'left':
            row, col = h // 2, h // 2 
        elif direction == 'up':
            row, col = h // 2, h // 2 - 1
        elif direction == 'down':
            row, col = h // 2 - 1, h // 2
```

The starting position is set based on whether the matrix size h is even or odd, and the chosen direction:
-  Odd Matrix, the start is at the center: ```(h // 2, h // 2)```.
- Even Matrix (h % 2 == 0): The starting point varies by direction:
  -   ```'right'```: Start in the top-left corner of the center block.
  -   ```'left'```: Start in the bottom-right corner of the center block.
  -   ```'up'```: Start in the bottom-left corner of the center block.
  -   ```'down'```: Start in the top-right corner of the center block.
---
#### Directions
```Python
if direction == 'up':
        directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]  # up -> right -> down -> left
    elif direction == 'down':
        directions = [(1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1)]  # down -> left -> up -> right
    elif direction == 'left':
        directions = [(0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)]  # left -> up -> right -> down
    elif direction == 'right':
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right -> down -> left -> up
```
Depending on the input (```up```, ```down```, ```left```, or ```right```), Each tuple ```(row_change, col_change)``` defines how to move in that direction:

---

#### Setting up Variables for the Loop
```Python
current_direction = 0
step_size = 1
total_steps = 0
steps_in_current_direction = 0
count = 0
```
```current_direction```: Keeps track of which direction to move in from the directions list.
```step_size```: The number of steps to take before changing direction. It starts at 1 and increases after every two direction changes.
```total_steps```: Tracks the total number of direction changes made.
```steps_in_current_direction```: Counts how many steps have been taken in the current direction.
```count```: Tracks how many elements have been filled in the matrix.

---

#### Word & Number filling.
```Python
if word:
        word = list(word)
        word_list_iter = []
        current_loop_time = 1
        loop_iter = 0
        for _ in range(h):
            word_list_iter.extend(word)
            loop_iter += 1
            if current_loop_time == loop_iter:
                word = [chr(ord(char) + 1) for char in word]
                current_loop_time += 1
                loop_iter = 0
        iter_count = 0
    else:
        num = 1
```
If ```word``` is ```True``` (a word is provided) it will get converted into a list of characters.

Then, it fills a new list ```word_list_iter``` with the word, incrementally shifting the characters with each loop iteration:
For example, if the word is ```"abcde"```, it will first fill ```"abcde"```, then ```"bcdef```", then ```"cdefg"```, and so on.

If no word is provided, the code defaults to filling the matrix with numbers, starting at 1.

---
#### Filling the Matrix in Spiral Order.
```Python
while count < h * h:
        if word:
            matrix[row][col] = word_list_iter[iter_count]
            iter_count += 1
        else:
            matrix[row][col] = str(num)
            num += 1
            
        count += 1
        steps_in_current_direction += 1

        row += directions[current_direction][0]
        col += directions[current_direction][1]

```

```count < h * h``` : The loop continues until every cell in the matrix is filled
If ```word``` is ```True```, the code inserts characters from ```word_list_iter``` into the matrix. The index ```iter_count``` is used to move through the list of characters.

If no word is provided, the code inserts incrementing numbers.

After each insertion, the code moves to the next position by updating the row and col values based on the current direction.

---

#### Change Directions.
```Python
if steps_in_current_direction == step_size:
    current_direction = (current_direction + 1) % 4
    steps_in_current_direction = 0
    total_steps += 1
    if total_steps % 2 == 0:
        step_size += 1
```
When the number of steps taken in the current direction matches the ```step_size```, the code changes direction (by incrementing ```current_direction```).

After every two direction changes, the ```step_size``` is increased by ```1```, allowing the spiral to expand outward as it moves around the matrix.

---
#### Finally, Return the Matrix.
```Python
return matrix
```
The function returns the completed matrix.

---

## ```print_spiral()```
#### Find maximum digits count.
```Python
def print_spiral(matrix):
    max_width = max(len(str(element)) for row in matrix for element in row)
```
Iterate through each element in each row of the matrix.

Each element is converted to a string ```(str(element))``` to find its length, ensuring that the function works for both numbers and strings
.
```max()``` is used to find the maximum length among all elements.

---

#### Print each of Row of the Matrix.
